# Risk-controlling Prediction with Distributionally Robust Optimization

This repo provides the code for the paper


**Risk-controlling Prediction with Distributionally Robust Optimization** by *Franck IUTZELER* and *Adrien MAZOYER* , Transactions on Machine Learning Research, 2025 <https://openreview.net/forum?id=d9dl6DyJpJ>. 


## Outline


- The file `test_rcps.py` provides the code for Section 4.1 and generates Figures 2 and 3 in the folder `RCPS_Out`
- The file `rcps_shift.py` provides the code for Section 4.2 and generates Figure 4 in the folder `RCPS_shift_Out`
- The file `learned_WDRO.py` provides the code for Section 4.3 and generates Figures 5 and 6 (among others) in the folder `Learned_WDRO_Out`
- The files `learned_WDRO_extra.py` and `learned_WDRO_extra2.py` provide the code for Appendix A.1 and A.2 respectively and generate the corresponding figures `Learned_WDRO_Extra_Out`
